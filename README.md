# Mint Classics Inventory Reduction Project

## Overview

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is considering closing one of their storage facilities. To support this data-driven business decision, the company seeks recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely service to customers. The goal is to ensure that products can still be shipped within 24 hours of order placement.

As a data analyst, MySQL Workbench will be used to examine the current data, isolate useful information, and write SQL queries to analyze the inventory. The findings will help formulate suggestions for inventory reduction, enabling the closure of a storage facility.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. **Database Import**: Importing an existing database using MySQL Workbench.
2. **Data Familiarization**: Reviewing a relational model diagram and exploring data tables in MySQL Workbench.
3. **SQL Analysis**: Analyzing inventory data using SQL queries that retrieve data from a multiple-table relational database. Commands include:
   - `SELECT`
   - `ORDER BY`
   - `WHERE`
   - `GROUP BY`
   - `HAVING`
4. **Recommendation Development**: Developing recommendations and suggestions for solving a business need/problem based on data analysis.
5. **Query Support**: Providing scripted SQL queries that support recommendations for inventory reduction.

## Project Outputs

By the end of this project, the following artifacts will be created:

- Detailed descriptions of a minimum of two suggestions for reducing inventory to facilitate the closure of a storage facility.
- One or more SQL queries/scripts that support each of the suggestions.

## Project Scenario

Mint Classics Company needs data-driven recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory. The data analysis will help answer questions such as:

1. Where are items stored, and can warehouse reorganization lead to the elimination of a facility?
2. How do inventory numbers relate to sales figures? Are the inventory counts appropriate for each item?
3. Are there items in storage that are not selling? Can any items be dropped from the product line?

## Project Objectives

1. Explore products currently in inventory.
2. Identify key factors influencing inventory reorganization/reduction.
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

## Project Challenge

Conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities. Steps include:

1. **Database Import**: Import the Mint Classics database into MySQL Workbench.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data using SQL queries to answer key questions.
3. **Insight Development**: Develop and document recommendations for inventory reduction.
4. **Query Support**: Write SQL queries that support the recommendations.

## Project Deliverables

- **Recommendations Document**: Detailed descriptions of at least two suggestions for reducing inventory.
- **SQL Scripts**: Queries that support the recommendations for inventory reduction.

## Getting Started

1. **Import Database**: Use MySQL Workbench to import the provided Mint Classics database.
2. **Review Data Model**: Familiarize with the relational model diagram and data tables.
3. **Run SQL Queries**: Write and execute SQL queries to analyze the data.
4. **Develop Recommendations**: Formulate suggestions for inventory reduction based on the analysis.
5. **Document Findings**: Compile recommendations and supporting SQL scripts into a final document.

## Tools and Technologies

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to analyze and manipulate data using SQL, develop data-driven recommendations, and support business decisions with meaningful insights. Completing this project showcases skills to potential employers and helps Mint Classics make informed decisions about inventory management.
