I conducted data analysis using SQL queries to address inventory-related business problems and formulated the following recommendations:

1. Inventory Optimization: Reduce the inventory of products with high stock but low sales to lower storage costs and optimize resource allocation.

2. Warehouse Review: Review warehouses with low or inactive inventory for potential closure or consolidation to cut rental costs and enhance inventory management.

3. Product Pricing Evaluation: Adjust prices of low-selling products to boost their attractiveness and sales.

4. Customer Analysis: Focus sales efforts on high-value customers by offering special incentives and tailored products.

5. Employee Performance Evaluation: Reward employees meeting or exceeding sales targets and provide training for those needing improvement.

6. Payment Analysis: Regularly monitor customer payment trends to mitigate credit risks and manage cash flow effectively.

7. Product Line Review: Evaluate and potentially improve or discontinue underperforming products to enhance overall profitability.

8. Credit Policy Evaluation: Assess and adjust credit policies to address customer credit issues and reduce risks.

Implementing these recommendations will optimize operations, improve profitability, and enhance customer service.
